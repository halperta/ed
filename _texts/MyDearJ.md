My dear Jay and Bobby, how are you both? I am fine and having

a very nice time and the weather is divine it's

beautiful and I love it I wish you could stay here

for a little while it's so relaxing it's so

good for your nerves I tell you I love it

very much I would never get tired of it.

Jay dear tell Ray that I miss Bonney

I ate lambchops and I didn't know what

to do with the bones I want\[ed\] to send them

to Bonny but the landlady he's too

\[Pikineas?\] so I gave them to her, well,

Bonny will have to wait until I come

home and then we'll have a good time 

again. How \[are\] Raye and Eddy how does she

feel and Raye, has she got soup greens?

You tell her she better have soup

green when I come home because

I don't make soup in here, and when I'll

come home I'll have to make soup every

day to make up for that time when

I didn't eat soup, so you tell Raye to have a lot, the soup
